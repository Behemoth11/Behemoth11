# Me : )

I am Daniel. I like technology; web-related development, to be more specific. I am studying computer science, hoping to obtain a bachelor's degree. I enjoy spending time learning modern frameworks and building cool projects.

I used java, python, node, typescript, go, React, Angular, and many more technologies to build fully-featured full-stack applications. As a full-stack dev, I also gained experience designing accessible and visually pleasing UI/UX experiences.
